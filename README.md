Hello! My name is Xianshuo Ji, and I am currently a junior undergraduate student at Nanjing Normal University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I have a strong passion for developing my skills in Java programming, with a particular focus on learning and building Java-based projects. 

Beyond my academic interests, I am also an avid table tennis player. Engaging in this sport not only brings me joy but also enhances my focus and resilience—qualities that I find invaluable in my studies and programming projects.

I am continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and work on challenging projects that allow me to apply what I’ve learned in practical, impactful ways.

This should work well as a concise and professional introduction. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
